This Google App Script will let you provide a list of User IDs and the new usernames they should use, along with showing you the status of the request, without having to know how to write code to use the Snipe-IT API.

This is most commonly used when a structural change in your organization (i.e. a rebrand resulting in new email addresses and email addresesses are used as usernames) happens. Since Snipe-IT uses usernames as the unique identifier for most purposes, this provides a shortcut to update those usernames all at once

## Important!

These scripts are *by design* data destructive. Please always make sure you [run a backup](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/backups) by going to `Admin Settings > Backups` before running them. That way if something gets messed up, you can easily restore to a known good point.

## Sheet Format

This script expects a CSV that has a header row (though it doesn't matter what the header names are) with the __first column__ being the __internal Snipe-IT asset ID__, and the second column being the new asset tag you want to change it to.

| Column Order | Column       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | User ID      | The unique ID of the user within Snipe-IT                                   |
| 2            | New Username | The new username value you wish to switch to                                |
| 3            | Status       | A column without values that we will update with the status of your request |


## Using this Script

You will need to update:


| Script Variable    | Description|
|--------------------| ---|
| `api_baseurl`      | This should be the base URL of your own Snipe-IT instance. It will usually look something like 'https://your-url/api/v1'. There should not be a trailing flash at the end of the URL, and it should start with `http://` or `https://`.|
| `api_bearer_token` | This will be the [API Bearer token](https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference/generating-api-tokens) generated by the user you want to take these actions on behalf of. Make sure the token value starts with `Bearer ` (include that space between the API key generated by Snipe-IT.) If you have trouble authenticating, [see this additional information](https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference/authenticating-with-the-api).|
