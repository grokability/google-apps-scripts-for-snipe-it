Snipe-IT offers a way to bulk regenerate asset tags all at once, but updating only *certain* asset tags in bulk can only be done via API, since asset tag is currently the unique identifier for assets within Snipe-IT.

This Google App Script will let you provide a list of Asset IDs and the new asset tags they should use, along with showing you the status of the request, without having to know how to write code to use the Snipe-IT API.

## Important!

These scripts are *by design* data destructive. Please always make sure you [run a backup](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/backups) by going to `Admin Settings > Backups` before running them. That way if something gets messed up, you can easily restore to a known good point.

## Sheet Format

This script expects a CSV that has a header row (though it doesn't matter what the header names are) with the __first column__ being the __internal Snipe-IT asset ID__, and the second column being the new asset tag you want to change it to.

| Column Order | Column | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | Asset ID          | The unique ID of the asset within Snipe-IT                                  |
| 2            | New Asset Tags    | The new asset tag value you wish to switch to                               |
| 3            | Status            | A column without values that we will update with the status of your request |

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api_baseurl`      | This should be the base URL of your own Snipe-IT instance. It will usually look something like 'https://your-url/api/v1'. There should not be a trailing slash at the end of the URL, and it should start with `http://` or `https://`.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
 | `api_bearer_token` | This will be the [API Bearer token](https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference/generating-api-tokens) generated by the user you want to take these actions on behalf of. Make sure the token value starts with `Bearer ` (include that space between the API key generated by Snipe-IT.) If you have trouble authenticating, [see this additional information](https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference/authenticating-with-the-api). |
