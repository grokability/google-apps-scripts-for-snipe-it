Snipe-IT offers thre ability to perform audits by ID using the API, however it is best utilized with a barcode scanner. If you have older tags, you can use this script to audit assets from a Google Sheet.

## Important!

These scripts are *by design* data destructive. Please always make sure you [run a backup](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/backups) by going to `Admin Settings > Backups` before running them. That way if something gets messed up, you can easily restore to a known good point.

## Sheet Format

This script expects a CSV that has a header row (though it doesn't matter what the header names are) with column order matching the order in the table below.

| Column Order | Column          | Description                                  | Required | Unique |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|--------|
| 1            | Asset Tag       | Asset tag for the asset you wish to audit    | Yes      | No     |
| 2            | Note            | Any audit notes you'd like to provide        | No       | No     |
| 3            | Next Audit Date | The date when the next audit for this asset is scheduled (YYYY-MM-DD format)         | No       | No     |
| 4            | Status          | Leave this empty                             |          |        |

| Script Variable    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api_baseurl`      | This should be the base URL of your own Snipe-IT instance. It will usually look something like 'https://your-url/api/v1'. There should not be a trailing slash at the end of the URL, and it should start with `http://` or `https://`.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `api_bearer_token` | This will be the [API Bearer token](https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference/generating-api-tokens) generated by the user you want to take these actions on behalf of. Make sure the token value starts with `Bearer ` (include that space between the API key generated by Snipe-IT.) If you have trouble authenticating, [see this additional information](https://snipe-it.readme.io/reference/authenticating-with-the-api). |
